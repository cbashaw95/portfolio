        <p>Welcome to my journey to becoming a programming professional.I am a former banker of 4 years who really needed a change of pace. The banking lifestyle was not for me. I found coding and developmnent to be quite entertaining and entralling while attempting to reskill myself for a new job. I found the idea of team work, dedication and probelem solving to be the neatest part of this process. 
          I love working with teams and others. I currently love to ride mountain bikes with friends and train jiu jitsu.</p>
